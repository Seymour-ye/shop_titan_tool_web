  This is a personal Ruby on Rails Project, as well as my first individual web application including front-end designing, 
  so it may not have a good look as it launched and any advices would be appreciated. If you have any advices on:
    <ul>
      <li>Interface appearance</li>
      <li>Features you think are useful to you but could not be found online</li>
      <li>Data you found that is wrong or out-dated</li>
    </ul>
